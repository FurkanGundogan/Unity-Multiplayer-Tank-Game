# Unity | Multiplayer Tank RTS Game

It is a multiplayer  real-time-strategy PC game that I developed while following the Udemy course.

        I used Mirror library to manage server-client communication.
    
        - Lobbies for up to 4 players to play together
        - Play with your friends on Steam
        - Building/Unit/Cost based RTS mechanism
